# Introduction

When the human visual system is exposed to complex, cluttered visual displays, selective attention allows us to focus our limited processing capacity on relevant objects while suppressing irrelevant objects. Visual selective attention relies on a set of interacting sub-systems which operate in concert to determine the current focus of attention. Bottom-up processing attempts to focus attention on salient stimuli like bright lights, or pop-out features like a red berry on a green background. Conversely, top-down attention is a system which prioritizes stimuli that match the current goals of an individual, for example when searching for your car in a busy carpark. Research has recently identified a third factor which influences the current focus of attention, referred to as selection history. As the name suggests, selection history refers to processes that direct attention toward stimuli because of an individual’s previous experiences or associations with those particular stimuli. This is distinct from bottom-up and top-down processes in that these stimuli may not be particularly salient in an objective sense, nor relevant to the current goals of the individual.

Experimental evidence for the central role that selection history plays in attention guidance has started to accumulate in the attention literature. Associating an object with reward, for example, has been shown to result in attention being oriented to that object even when participants move on to different tasks where the target has changed and rewards are no longer being given [@laurent2015valuable;@wang2018stimuli;@hickey2013reward;@donohue2016rapid]. Evidence for the effect of selection history also comes from intertrial priming, an effect observed in visual search tasks with target features changing from trial to trial. Intertrial priming is the observation that target features repeat on two trials, participants respond significantly faster to the target repetition than in other trials [@fecteau2007priming;@nakayama2004short;@maljkovic1994priming;@wolfe2003changing]. Similarly, subtle statistical regularities in object location and display configuration have been shown to speed participant responses in a way which suggests that historic associations are incorporated in visual search and help to determine the locus of attention [@ferrante2018altering;@wang2018statistical;@failing2019spatial;@theeuwes2018visual;@theeuwes2019goal;@wang2018statistical]. Reward association, priming, and statistical regularity are three prominent lines of research demonstrating the role that selection history plays in attention guidance, research has continued to build on these effects in order to understand the dynamics of selection history within the broader attention system.

A central question of interest in this field of research is the extent to which selection history effects persist across time. @anderson_learned_2011 used an experimental design in which participants were trained on a task which associated colours with reward, and then subsequently performed a test phase in which they were asked to responded to shapes and to ignore coloured distractors. Their results showed that distractors in the high value colour biased attention more than distractors in the low value colour, but that this effect extinguished over repeated trials. On the other hand, when they repeated this task using a shorter test phase, and brought participants back after at least four days, results showed that the distractor effects persisted across days without any further training [@anderson2011value]. This effect has since been shown to persist not just for days following the initial session, but for up to 9 months after training [@anderson_persistence_2013].

Similar persistence of selection history has been shown by @feldmann2015you using an experimental design that used even more general mechanisms of selection history that did not include explicit reward. In their version of the task, @feldmann2015you had participants perform a learning task where half of participants categorised colour singletons, and the other half categorised shape singletons. All participants also performed a search task where a shape singleton contained the target, and a colour singleton served as a distractor. Importantly, the shape and colour features used in the search task were different from the shapes and colour features presented during learning. Their results showed that participants who had learned to categorise colours in the learning task, were more distracted by the colour singleton in the search task relative to participants who had learned to categorise shapes. This was taken as evidence that a history of attending to a feature dimension, like colour, can lead to increased attentional orienting to singletons in the dimension on a separate task. This was reinforced by ERP data which showed decreased shape selection, and increased distraction by colours for participants in the colour group, and these effects also persisted when the two tasks were performed on separate days.

While previous work shows that brief training periods can instatiate representations that bias attention for a significant period of time, little work has sought to understand how this representation modulates as training is extended. In the field psychophysics it is broadly recognised that the adult brain remains plastic at many levels of processing [@sampaio-baptista_white_2017;@thomas_teaching_2013;@sailor_adult_2017]. In perceptual learning studies there is evidence that participants continue to improve on abilities like spatial frequency discrimination and object recognition across multiple sessions of training [@dosher_visual_2017;@fine_comparing_2002]. Given that the practical role of selection history is presumed to be to allow an individual's accumulated experience to influence their attention, we might expect that this process also benefits from extended periods of training. One of the goals of the present experiment is to evaluate whether extending a person's experience with a feature dimension results in concomitant increases in that feature's effect on attention in a separate task. As yet, it is unknown whether selection history representations are very plastic and impact asymptotes within a single session, or whether they may continue to build over time with repeated exposure.

The persistence of selection history effects over time raises a similar question regarding the conditions under which this representation might be extinguished. In addition to evidence that selection history does not dissipate over long periods of extinction, a growing set of literature has shown that selection history effects are also resistant to interference by top-down attentional control mechanisms. In the paradigm described above by @feldmann2015you, participants performed learn trials and search trials in a randomly intermixed fashion and therefore did not know which task they would perform on each trial. This means that participants in the colour group do not know whether they are about to categorise a colour, or search for the shape singleton on the next trial, and therefore could not use top-down control during search to counteract their selection history. @kadel2017selection on the other hand used versions where participants were either cued prior to the onset of a task display, or carried out the tasks in a fixed pattern (learn-learn-search-search-learn-learn etc.). Behavioural measures and ERP evidence both showed that despite increasing participants' opportunity to prepare top-down attentional templates for the upcoming trial, selection history effects continued to bias attention.

The evidence so far implies that representations established by an individual's selection history will not necessarily decay over long periods of time, nor in the face of contradictory top-down goals. Therefore, an open question remains with regard to how representations established by an individual's selection history might be overwritten. One unexplored possibility is that selection history biases remain until alternate, or contradictory selaction history is established through retraining. A similar effect is seen in limited capacity systems such as working memory, where experimental evidence has been used to suggest that stored objects or features are overwritten as newer information is received [@oberauer_interference_2008;@oberauer_interference_2009]. This has led to the introduction of interference models of working memory [@oberauer_interference_2017], however it remains to be seen whether similar models may be applicable to the mechanisms underlying selection history. A second goal of the present experiment, therefore, is to understand how multiple, contradictory training histories interact to direct attention during performance on a separate task.

In the current experiment, we use a modified version of the paradigm developed by @feldmann2015you to evaluate the development and persistence of selection history effects in two novel ways. Firstly, we aimed to understand how selection history develops as the learning and search is repeated across 3 separate days. Participants in our task were allocated to either colour or shape learning, and then performed this learning along with the search task across 3 days of training. We expected that if selection history effects continue to increase as learning continues, then we would observe changes from day one to day three, whereas if the effects reach a maximum after an initial short learning session, then no further improvement would be observed. Secondly, in light of evidence that top-down control cannot eliminate the effects of selection history, we sought to understand how selection history effects are impacted by the development of a novel, and contradictory selection history. To this end, half of the participants in our task swapped their learning assignment on day two of the experiment. That is, participants in the colour group had to start performing shape categorisation and participants originally in the shape group had to start performing colour categorisation. This design would allow us to see whether selection history operates in a first-come-first-served manner, preferentially directing attention to features that were a part of initial learning. Or whether selection history is more plastic and can be overwritten when the demands on the system change.

# Methods

## Participants

39 participants with normal or corrected-to-normal vision (tested using an Oculus Binoptometer 3) participated in the task for either payment or course credit. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Department of Psychology at the University of Marburg, and all participants gave written and informed consent prior to the start of the experiment in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups, the colour-colour group (ten participants, six female, one left handed, mean age = 23.6, SD = 2.7), colour-shape group (nine participants, three female, one left handed, mean age = 23.3, SD = 2.5), shape-shape group (ten participants, eight female, zero left handed, mean age = 22.6, SD = 1.8), or shape-colour group (ten participants, six female, two left handed, mean age = 23.7, SD = 2.0). 

## Experiment tasks

In this study, participants performed two different tasks. A categorisation task was used to induce selection history of one of two feature dimensions (either shape or colour depending on an individual's group assignment), while a search task was used to measure the effect of these different selection histories on attentional orienting.

### Categorisation task

Categorisation trials began with a 500 ms fixation cross in the center of the screen. Eight stimuli were then presented simultaneously in a circular arrangement with a radius of 6.3$^\circ$ of visual angle for 200 ms (see Figure\ \@ref(fig:stimDisplays)A). Six of these objects were unfilled grey circles, one was an unfilled coloured circle (either blue or green randomly selected on each trial), and one was an unfilled grey shape singleton (either pentagon or triangle selected randomly on each trial). The colour singleton and the shape singleton were constrained to appear in only four of the eight possible locations along either the vertical or horizontal midline. In half of the categorisation trials (288 trials), the shape singleton was presented on one of the vertical midline positions while the colour singleton was presented on one of the lateral positions on the horizontal midline. In the other half of categorisation trials the colour singleton was on the vertical midline while the shape singleton was lateralised (see Figure\ \@ref(fig:stimDisplays)A). Participants had two response keys for the categorisation task and after selecting one of these keys, they were given audotiry feedback (a buzzing soudn following incorrect responses) informing them whether they had selected the correct response. At the beginning of the task, participants were not told the correct stimulus response pairing, but had to learn which key was correct for a given display on a trial-and-error basis. For half of the participants (the colour group) the correct response was based on the colour singleton (e.g. key 1 when blue was shown, key 2 when green was shown). For the other half (the shape group), the correct response was based on the shape singleton (e.g. key 1 when a pentagon was shown, key 2 when a triangle was shown).The trial would end when participants made their response, up to a maximum of 2000 ms.

### Search trials.

Search trials began with a 500 ms fixation cross in the center of the screen. Next, eight stimuli were presented in a circular arrangement with a radius of 6.3$^\circ$ of visual angle for an interval of 200 ms (see Figure\ \@ref(fig:stimDisplays)B). Six of these were always unfilled grey circles, one was the target - an unfilled grey diamond, and one was either another unfilled grey circle (in the target only condition) or an unfilled red circle (in the distractor present condition). Each of these stimuli contained a line of varying orientations and participants were required to indicate whether the line contained by the target diamond was oriented horizontally or vertically. The trial would end when participants made their response, up to a maximum of 2000 ms. One third of the search trials (192 trials) were target only trials with 7 grey circles and one grey diamond target. The other two thirds of the search trials were distractor present trials in which one of the circles was coloured red. In half of these distractor present search trials (192 trials), the target diamond was placed on the vertical midline and the coloured distractor was lateralised to either the left or right (chosen randomly on each trial) along the horizontal midline. In the remaining trials (192 trials) the coloured distractor was placed on the vertical midline and the target diamond was lateralised to either the left or right (chosen randomly on each trial) on the horizontal midline (see Figure\ \@ref(fig:stimDisplays)B).

## Stimuli.

Each stimulus presented during the categorisation and search trials was presented on a dark grey background (RGB: 60,60,60) and subtended 2.3$^\circ$ of visual angle. A fixation cross (0.6$^\circ$) was located in the centre of the screen throughout the experiment in order to help participants maintain central fixation. The physical luminance of the grey (RGB: 110,110,110), green (RGB: 48,171,48), blue (RGB: 48,48,171), and red (RGB: 171,48,48) stimulus colours was balanced using a luminance meter (Konica Minolta LS-100).

(ref:stimDispFig) Example task displays for the categorisation (A) and search tasks (B). In each display, one singleton is lateralised and the other is on the midline in order to allow for the calculation of EEG activity elicited by the lateral stimulus. When presented with a categorisartion display, participant's response depended on their group assignment. Participants int he colour group had to categorise the colour singleton in the display (eg. push button a if it's blue, and b if it's green), whereas participants int he shape group had to categorise the shape singleton (eg. push button a if it's a pentagon, and b if it's a triangle). In the search tasks, all participants were required to find the line within the diamond and indicate whether it was horizontal or vertical. (consistent history vs. contradictory history?)

## Experimental procedure

Participants came in for three separate sessions and performed the two different tasks within each session (categorisation task and a search task). In all sessions, participants were seated in a comfortable chair in a dimly lit room with their eyes 100cm away from the screen (LCD-TN Samsung Syncmaster 2233). An Erogodex DX1 response pad was placed on their lap with 6 keys arranged so that participants could use the index and middle finger of each hand to respond to the task, while the thumb on each hand could be used to perform task selection between trials. Stimulus presentation and response collection was controlled by E-Prime 2.0 and audio feedback was presented by two stereo speakers (Logitech Z120 2.0) placed behind the screen. 
In session one, participants were first familiarised with the categorisation task while feedback was provided, before continuing to a mixed practice block with categorisation and search trials randomly interleaved. Participants then began 18 blocks of 64 trials with the two tasks randomly interleaved while EEG was recorded, for a total of 1152 trials (50% categorisation, 50% search). Session two was the relearning session where participants were required to relearn some part of the categorisation task depending on their group assignment. Half of the participants had to switch feature dimension in the categorisation task. Those in the colour-shape group for example, had categorised coloured stimuli in the first session, but now had to switch to shape categorisation in session two. Likewise, participants in the shape-colour group who started with shape categorisation in the first session had to switch to colour categorisation. The other half of participants (those in the colour-colour, and shape-shape group) continued to categorise the same feature dimension, however, they had to switch response assignment. For example, if a participant in the colour group had learned to push key 1 for green and key 2 for blue, they would now have to push key 1 for blue and key 2 for green. The search task remained the same for all groups and this session contained only 4 blocks of 64 trials, for a total of 256 trials (50% categorisation, 50% search). EEG was not recorded in session two. In session three, all participants continued with the tasks that they had learned in session two, however, the task ran for 27 blocks of 32 trials (864 total, 50% categorisation and 50% search) and EEG was recorded.

(ref:expDesignFig) Outline of the experimental design. 40 participants were recruited and assigned randomly to either the colour categorization group (visualized by the color circles on the upper left) or the shape categorization group (visualized by the shape contours on the lower left) on Day1. One Day2, half of the participants in each group were made to switch categorisation assignments (indexed by the intersecting arrows) while the other half continued to categorize the same dimension (non-intersecting arrows), resulting in 4 groups in the final session on Day3. Colour categorisers who had either an unchanged, or changed selection history, and shape cateogrisers with either an unchange, or changed selection history (right side of the graph).

include_graphics("Figures/CSL3D design.jpg", auto_pdf = FALSE)
```

## EEG recording

EEG activity was recorded continuously at 1000Hz using Brain Products 64 channel actiCAP Ag/AgCl electodes. The electrodes were arranged according to the modified combinatorial nomenclature (MCN) for the 10-10 system. The online reference was FCz and the COM sensor was located on the z axis between FCz and Cz. EEG activity was preamplified by the active electrodes and then passed to a brain products brainamp amplifier with 16 bit A/D conversion, an input impedance of 10MOhms, and an antialiasing filter with a 1000Hz low pass cut off. Impedances were kept below 5kOHms and active shielding was used throughout for attenuating common mode noise.

## EEG processing

EEG data were processed using the EEGLAB toolbox in MATLAB. First, data were segmented into 700ms epochs (-200 to 500ms around each search or categorisation display) and baselined so that the average of the pre-stimulus period was set to zero for each event. For artifact rejection a HEOG channel was created by taking the voltage difference between the electrodes on the outer canthi of each eye, and a VEOG was created by taking the voltage difference between the electrodes above and below the left eye. These channels were filtered using a lowpass value of 35Hz in order to reduce false positives, and then trials containing either +/- 35mV in the HEOG channel (within 300ms post stimulus presentation) or +/- 80mV in the VEOG channel were removed. Trials containing +/- 80mv in the channels of interest (PO3, PO7, PO4, and PO8) were also removed and the data were referenced to the average of all channels. Left hemisphere channels (PO3, PO7) were averaged together, and right hemisphere channels (PO4, PO8) were averaged together so that contralateral and ipsilateral ERPs could be calculated for each condition.

## Statistical analysis

Throughout the results section data are analysed to focus on three effects, the initial training effect, extended training effect, and the retraining effect. For the *initial training effect*, we focus on data from the first session and make comparisons between participants who are performing colour categorisation to participants performing shape categorisation. This represents a replication of previous studies showing that participants who categorise colour in the categorisation task (when compared to shape categorisation) are more vulnerable to distraction by colour singletons in the search task. For the *extended training effect*, we evaluate how this *initial training effect* is modulated by an extended period of training for another 2 days. Therefore, we focus on participants who continue to categorise the same feature dimension across all 3 days of the experiment, and compare their response in the first session to their responses in the final session. This allows us to understand whether extended performance of these tasks results in strengthened selection history effects and therefore an even greater difference between shape and colour categorisers, whether this effect is diminished by repeated practice for both groups, or whether the selection history effect reaches its peak in the first session and is unaffected by repeated training. For the *retraining effect*, we aim to understand how changing an individual’s selection history on day two impacts on selection history effects on day three. To this end, we focus on performance from day three, and split participant groups not only by the feature dimension that they are currently categorising, but by whether or not the relevant dimension has changed since day one (e.g. from shape categorisation to colour categorisaiton and vice versa). In this way we aim to understand, for example, for participants currently performing colour categorisation, whether their performance is different if they have a previous history of shape categorisation as compared to unchanged history of colour categorisation across all 3 days.

### Behavioural analyses

For behavioural analyses we removed trials with exceptionally long response times (greater than 2.5 standard deviations above the mean, calculated separately for each participant and each task) resulting in the removal of an average of 2.60% of the categorisation trials and 2.80% of search trials. We also removed trials with incorrect responses resulting in the removal of a further 4.06% of the categorisation trials and 4.60% of search trials.

### ERP analyses

Participants were excluded if more than 30% of their trials contained excessive eye movements or artifacts (as described in the EEG processing section) in either the learning or search task, resulting in 3 exclusions. Our analyses focused on two components of interest, the N$_{\text{T}}$ and P$_{\text{D}}$. To identify the component time windows for each analysis, we collapsed across all participants and all independent variables to create a grand average ERP. For the N$_{\text{T}}$ we then centred a 50ms window on the peak negativity between 150 and 350ms post-stimulus from the grand average ERP. For the P$_{\text{D}}$, we centred a 50ms window on the peak positivity that occurred later than 200ms post-stimulus.

### Categorisation trials

#### Initial training.

```{r catInitMeansd}
main.rt.colour <- cat.rt.init.aov$data$long %>% filter(InitSess=="Colour") %>% summarise(mean=mean(ResponseTime), sd = sd(ResponseTime))
main.rt.shape <- cat.rt.init.aov$data$long %>% filter(InitSess=="Shape") %>% summarise(mean=mean(ResponseTime), sd = sd(ResponseTime))

main.acc.colour <- cat.acc.init.aov$data$long %>% filter(InitSess=="Colour") %>% summarise(mean=mean(Accuracy), sd = sd(Accuracy))
main.acc.shape <- cat.acc.init.aov$data$long %>% filter(InitSess=="Shape") %>% summarise(mean=mean(Accuracy), sd = sd(Accuracy))
```

When focussing on performance from Day1, independent samples t-tests showed no significant difference between the shape group and the colour group in terms of response times (`r apa_print(cat.rt.init.aov)$full_result$InitSess`) and accuracy (`r apa_print(cat.acc.init.aov)$full_result$InitSess`).

#### Extended training.

```{r catExtdMeansd}
main.rt.colour <- cat.rt.extd.aov$data$long %>% filter(InitSess=="Colour") %>% summarise(mean=mean(ResponseTime), sd = sd(ResponseTime))
main.rt.shape <- cat.rt.extd.aov$data$long %>% filter(InitSess=="Shape") %>% summarise(mean=mean(ResponseTime), sd = sd(ResponseTime))
main.rt.SessOne <- cat.rt.extd.aov$data$long %>% filter(Session=="X1") %>% summarise(mean=mean(ResponseTime), sd = sd(ResponseTime))
main.rt.SessThr <- cat.rt.extd.aov$data$long %>% filter(Session=="X3") %>% summarise(mean=mean(ResponseTime), sd = sd(ResponseTime))

main.acc.colour <- cat.acc.extd.aov$data$long %>% filter(InitSess=="Colour") %>% summarise(mean=mean(Accuracy), sd = sd(Accuracy))
main.acc.shape <- cat.acc.extd.aov$data$long %>% filter(InitSess=="Shape") %>% summarise(mean=mean(Accuracy), sd = sd(Accuracy))
main.acc.SessOne <- cat.acc.extd.aov$data$long %>% filter(Session=="X1") %>% summarise(mean=mean(Accuracy), sd = sd(Accuracy))
main.acc.SessThr <- cat.acc.extd.aov$data$long %>% filter(Session=="X3") %>% summarise(mean=mean(Accuracy), sd = sd(Accuracy))
```

For participants whose categorisation task remained unchanged across the 3 days, a 2x2 mixed ANOVA evaluating the effects of group (colour vs shape) and session (Day1 vs Day3) on response times revealed a significant main effect of session, however, showed that response times were slower on Day3 (`r mean_and_sd(main.rt.SessThr)`) than Day1 (`r mean_and_sd(main.rt.SessOne)`, `r apa_print(cat.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$Session`). There was no main effect of group (`r apa_print(cat.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess`), and no significant interaction between group and session (`r apa_print(cat.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess_Session`) indicating that the RT difference was the same for both groups. 
When this analysis was repeated for accuracy, we again saw a significant main effect of session revealed that participants became significantly less accurate by Day3 (`r mean_and_sd(main.acc.SessThr)`) compared to Day1 (`r mean_and_sd(main.rt.SessOne)`, `r apa_print(cat.acc.extd.aov)$full_result$Session`). There was no main effect of group (`r apa_print(cat.acc.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess`), and no significant interaction between group and session (`r apa_print(cat.acc.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess_Session`).

#### Retraining.

```{r catRetrMeansd}
main.rt.colour <- cat.rt.retr.aov$data$long %>% filter(FinSess=="Colour") %>% summarise(mean=mean(ResponseTime), sd = sd(ResponseTime))
main.rt.shape <- cat.rt.retr.aov$data$long %>% filter(FinSess=="Shape") %>% summarise(mean=mean(ResponseTime), sd = sd(ResponseTime))
main.rt.Switch <- cat.rt.retr.aov$data$long %>% filter(retrain=="Switch") %>% summarise(mean=mean(ResponseTime), sd = sd(ResponseTime))
main.rt.Stay <- cat.rt.retr.aov$data$long %>% filter(retrain=="Stay") %>% summarise(mean=mean(ResponseTime), sd = sd(ResponseTime))

main.acc.colour <- cat.acc.retr.aov$data$long %>% filter(FinSess=="Colour") %>% summarise(mean=mean(Accuracy), sd = sd(Accuracy))
main.acc.shape <- cat.acc.retr.aov$data$long %>% filter(FinSess=="Shape") %>% summarise(mean=mean(Accuracy), sd = sd(Accuracy))
main.acc.Switch <- cat.acc.retr.aov$data$long %>% filter(retrain=="Switch") %>% summarise(mean=mean(Accuracy), sd = sd(Accuracy))
main.acc.Stay <- cat.acc.retr.aov$data$long %>% filter(retrain=="Stay") %>% summarise(mean=mean(Accuracy), sd = sd(Accuracy))
```

To evaluate the effects of retraining we focussed on data from Day3 and used a 2x2 mixed ANOVA to evaluate the effect of categorisation group (colour vs shape), and training history (changed vs unchanged) on response times. The results showed no significant main effect of group (`r apa_print(cat.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$FinSess`), no significant main effect of training history (`r apa_print(cat.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$retrain`), and no interaction between group and training history (`r apa_print(cat.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$retrain_FinSess`). When this analysis was repeated with accuracy as the dependent variable, we again saw no significant main effect of group (`r apa_print(cat.acc.retr.aov)$full_result$FinSess`), no significant main effect of training history (`r apa_print(cat.acc.retr.aov)$full_result$retrain`), and no interaction between group and training history (`r apa_print(cat.acc.retr.aov)$full_result$retrain_FinSess`).

(ref:srchRTCaption) RT in the search task showed a main effect of distractor presence (distractor interference effect) which interacted with group (larger interference for the colour group). For participants who don't change learning assignment, distractor interference decreases by day 3 (not different for shape vs colour groups).

#### Initial training.

```{r srchInitMeansd}
main.rt.colour <- srch.rt.init.aov$data$long %>% filter(InitSess=="Colour") %>% summarise(mean=mean(ResponseTime), sd = sd(ResponseTime))
main.rt.shape <- srch.rt.init.aov$data$long %>% filter(InitSess=="Shape") %>% summarise(mean=mean(ResponseTime), sd = sd(ResponseTime))

When focusing on performance from Day1, a 2x2 mixed ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of group (colour vs shape) and distractor presence (present vs absent) on response times in the search task. The results showed no significant main effect of group (`r apa_print(srch.rt.init.aov)$full_result$InitSess`), however there was a significant main effect of distractor presence where participants performed slower when a coloured distractor was present (`r mean_and_sd(main.rt.TD)`) than when the distractor was absent (`r mean_and_sd(main.rt.TO)`, `r apa_print(srch.rt.init.aov)$full_result$CompCond`). We also observed a significant interaction between group and distractor presence (`r apa_print(srch.rt.init.aov)$full_result$InitSess_CompCond`), and follow-up tests revealed that the distractor interference effect was larger for participants in the colour group (`r srch.rt.init.fup$full_result$TD_TO_Colour`) than the shape group (`r srch.rt.init.fup$full_result$TD_TO_Shape`). These effects are consistent with previous work showing that participants who focus on colour during the categorisation are more distracted by a colour distractor during the search task.

This analysis was repeated with accuracy as the dependent variable. The results showed no significant effect of group (`r apa_print(srch.acc.init.aov)$full_result$InitSess`), no significant main effect of distractor presence (`r apa_print(srch.acc.init.aov)$full_result$CompCond`), and no interaction between group and distractor presence (`r apa_print(srch.acc.init.aov)$full_result$InitSess_CompCond`).

#### Extended training.

```

For participants whose search task remained unchanged across the 3 days, a 2x2x2 mixed ANOVA evaluated the effects of group (colour vs shape), session (Day1 vs Day3), and distractor presence (present vs absent) on response times. The results showed a significant main effect of session (`r apa_print(srch.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$Session`), and a significant interaction between session and distractor interference (`r apa_print(srch.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$Session_CompCond`). Follow-up comparisons revealed that while distractor intereference was present on Day1 (`r srch.rt.extd.SessxComp.fup$full_result$TD_TO_X1`), it decreased by Day3 (`r srch.rt.extd.SessxComp.fup$full_result$TD_TO_X3`) implying that extended training on the task lead to decreased interference by colour distractors during search irrespective of group (see table X   resutls).

This analysis was repeated using search task accuracy as the dependent variable. Results showed a significant main effect of session (`r apa_print(srch.acc.extd.aov)$full_result$Session`), where participants were more accurate in the final session suggesting a general improvement on the search task. No other main effects or interactions were significant (see table X).

#### Retraining.

To evaluate the effects of retraining we focussed on data from Day3 and used a 2x2x2 mixed ANOVA to evaluate the effect of Day3 categorisation group (colour vs shape), training history (changed vs unchanged), and distractor presence (present vs absent) on response times. The results showed no significant effect of training history (`r apa_print(srch.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$retrain`), however we did see a significant interaction between gorup and distractor presence reflective of the results observed in during initial training (`r apa_print(srch.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$FinsSess_CompCond`). Follow-up comparisons revealed the participants who were categorising colours on Day3 had a significant distractor interference effect (`r srch.rt.retr.fup$full_result$TD_TO_Colour`), however those participants categorising shapes did not (`r srch.rt.retr.fup$full_result$TD_TO_Shape`). 

This analysis was repeated using search task accuracy as the dependent variable, however, the results did not show any significant main effects of training history (`r apa_print(srch.acc.retr.aov)$full_result$retrain`). We also saw no other significant main effects and no significant interactions (see table X).

## ERP results

### Learn

#### Initial training

```{r loadLearnInitERPResults}
load('DataOutput/lernInitERPANOVAs.RData')
```

(ref:lernInitERPcaption) ERPs from Day1. Colour singletons elicit significant lateralised positivity for the shape group, NT is not significant for colour group. PD is significant for the colour group. Shape singletons elicit an NT for the shape group but not the colour group, and a PD for both groups.

```{r loadlernInitPlot, fig.cap = "(ref:lernInitERPcaption)"}
include_graphics("Figures/lernInitERPs.tiff", auto_pdf = FALSE)
```

When focusing on performance from Day1, a 2x2 mixed ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of group (colour vs shape) and electrode laterality (contralateral vs ipsilateral) on ERP component amplitude in the categorisation task. This analysis was carried out for lateralised colour singletons (where the shape singleton was on the midline), and for lateralised shape singletons (where the colour singleton was on the midline. In each case we extracted the amplitude of two time windows corresponding to the NT component and the PD component.

##### Lateralised colour singleton

Results for the NT time range showed a significant interaction between group and laterality (`r learn.Init.ColNt.results$full_result$Group1_Contra`). Follow-up comparisons of this interaction revealed a significant positivity was elicited for participants in the shape group (`r learn.Init.ColNt.fup$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_S`) and a small, but non-significant negativity in the colour group (`r learn.Init.ColNt.fup$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_C`). The results for the PD time range also produced a significant interaction between group and laterality (`r learn.Init.ColPd.results$full_result$Group1_Contra`). Follow-up comparisons of this interaction showed that the colour singleton elicited a significant PD for participants in the colour group (`r learn.Init.ColPd.fup$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_C`), and a smaller, non-significant positivity in the shape group (`r learn.Init.ColPd.fup$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_S`).

##### Lateralised shape singleton

Results for the NT time range showed a significant interaction between group and laterality (`r learn.Init.ShpNt.results$full_result$Group1_Contra`), and follow-up comparisons showed a significant NT was elicited by shape singletons for participants in the shape group (`r learn.Init.ShpNt.fup$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_S`) but no lateralised difference was detected for the colour group (`r learn.Init.ShpNt.fup$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_C`). In the PD time range, we did not observe any significant interaction between group and laterality on component amplitude (`r learn.Init.ShpPd.results$full_result$Group1_Contra`).

#### Extended training

```{r loadLearnExtdERPResults}
load('DataOutput/lernExtdERPANOVAs.RData')
```

(ref:lernExtdERPcaption) ERPs for extended training (groups who categorise the same feature across all 3 days). Colour singleton elicits NT and PD, these don't interact with group, or session. Shape singleton elicits NT for shape group but not colour group, and NT increases from day1 to day3. Shape singleton elicits a PD that doesn't interact with group or session.

```{r loadlernExtdPlot, fig.cap = "(ref:lernExtdERPcaption)"}
include_graphics("Figures/lernExtdERPs.tiff", auto_pdf = FALSE)

For participants whose categorisation task remained unchanged across the 3 days, a 2x2x2 mixed ANOVA evaluated the effects of group (colour vs shape), electrode laterality (contralateral vs ipsilateral), and session (Day1 vs Day3) on ERP component amplitude. This analysis was carried out for the NT elicited by each stimulus type (lateralised colour singletons and lateralised shape singletons) and for the PD elicited by each stimulus type.

```{r catExtdERPMeansd}
main.colnt.contra <- learn.Extd.ColNt.aov$data$long %>% filter(Contra=="Contralateral") %>% summarise(mean=mean(mV), sd = sd(mV))

main.Shppd.day3 <- learn.Extd.ShpPd.aov$data$long %>% filter(Session=="Day3") %>% summarise(mean=mean(mV), sd = sd(mV))
```

##### Lateralised colour singleton

The results for the NT time range showed no significant main effect of session(`r learn.Extd.ColNt.results$full_result$Session`), and no interactions between session and any of the other variables (see table X). 

The results for the PD time range showed a significant main effect of session in which the ERP amplitude was larger on Day3 (`r mean_and_sd(main.colpd.day1)`) than Day1 (`r mean_and_sd(main.colpd.day3)`, `r learn.Extd.ColPd.results$full_result$Session`). This effect did not interact with electrode laterality (`r learn.Extd.ColPd.results$full_result$Contra_Session`) and therefore represents an effect in the unsubtracted ERP but not the PD component itself.

##### Lateralised shape singleton

The results of the NT time range showed no main effect of session (`r learn.Extd.ShpNt.results$full_result$Session`). There was, however, a significant interaction between laterality and session (`r learn.Extd.ShpNt.results$full_result$Contra_Session`), and follow-up comparisons showed that there was a significant NT present on Day1 (`r learn.Extd.ShpNt.fup.ContraSession$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_Day1`) which increased in amplitude on Day3 (`r learn.Extd.ShpNt.fup.ContraSession$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_Day3`).

The results of the PD timerange showed a main effect of session in which ERP amplitude on Day1 (`r mean_and_sd(main.Shppd.day1)`), increased by Day3 (`r mean_and_sd(main.Shppd.day3)`, `r learn.Extd.ShpPd.results$full_result$Session`). There effect did not interact with electrode laterality (`r learn.Extd.ShpPd.results$full_result$Contra_Session`) and therefore represents an effect in the unsubtracted ERP amplitude but not the PD component itself.

##### Lateralised colour singleton

The results for the NT time range showed no significant main effect of training history (`r learn.Retr.ColNt.results$full_result$GroupP`), and training history did not interact with electrode laterality (`r learn.Retr.ColNt.results$full_result$GroupP_Contra`) nor group (`r learn.Retr.ColNt.results$full_result$Group2_GroupP`).

The results for the PD time range showed no significant main effect of training history (`r learn.Retr.ColPd.results$full_result$GroupP`), and training history did not interact with neither electrode laterality (`r learn.Retr.ColPd.results$full_result$GroupP_Contra`) nor group (`r learn.Retr.ColPd.results$full_result$Group2_GroupP`).

### Search

#### Initial training

```{r loadInitERPResults}
load('DataOutput/SrchInitERPANOVAs.RData')
```

(ref:srchInitERPcaption) Search ERPs on Day1. NT present for the shape group for targets presented alone and targets presented with distractors. PD was present for both groups but larger for the colour group.

```{r loadSrchInitPlot, fig.cap = "(ref:srchInitERPcaption)"}
include_graphics("Figures/SrchInitERPs.tiff", auto_pdf = FALSE)
```

When focussing on performance from Day1, a 2x2 mixed ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of group (colour vs shape) and electrode lateralirty (contralateral vs ipsilateral) on ERP component amplitude in the search task. This analysis was carried out for the NT elicited by targets in the distractor absent trials, the NT elicited by lateralised targets int he presence of a midline distractor, and for the PD elicited by lateralised distractors in the presence of midline targets.

##### Target response - Distractor absent trials

The results showed no significant main effect of group on NT amplitude (`r search.Init.TO.results$full_result$Group1`), however there was a main effect of electrode laterality (`r search.Init.TO.results$full_result$Contra`), and an interaction between group and laterality (`r search.Init.TO.results$full_result$Group1_Contra`). Follow-up comparisons of this interaction showed a significant NT was elicited by targets for participants in the shape group (`r search.Init.TO.fup$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_S`) but not the colour group (`r search.Init.TO.fup$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_C`).

##### Target response - Distractor present trials

The results showed no significant main effect of group on NT amplitude (`r search.Init.TD.results$full_result$Group1`), however there was a main effect of electrode laterality (`r search.Init.TD.results$full_result$Contra`), and an interaction between group and laterality (`r search.Init.TD.results$full_result$Group1_Contra`). Follow-up comparisons of this interaction showed a significant NT was elicited by targets for participants in the shape group (`r search.Init.TD.results$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_S`) and that the NT was present but reduced for the colour group (`r search.Init.TD.results$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_C`).

##### Distractor response - Distractor present trials

The results showed no significant main effect of group on PD amplitude (`r search.Init.DTpd.results$full_result$Group1`), however there was a main effect of electrode laterality (`r search.Init.DTpd.results$full_result$Contra`), and an interaction between group and laterality (`r search.Init.DTpd.results$full_result$Group1_Contra`). Follow-up comparisons of this interaction showed a significant PD was elicited by targets for participants in the shape group (`r search.Init.DTpd.results$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_S`) and that the PD was enhanced for the colour group (`r search.Init.DTpd.results$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_C`).

#### Extended training

```{r loadExtdERPResults}
load('DataOutput/SrchExtdERPANOVAs.RData')
```

(ref:srchExtdERPcaption) ERPs for extended training (groups who categorise the same feature across all 3 days). NT present for shape group in the target only and target-distractor trials. NT absent for colour group in the target only trials and present but reduced in the target-distractor trials. PD is present in both sessions but reduced by Day3, doesn't interact with group.

```{r loadSrchExtdPlot, fig.cap = "(ref:srchExtdERPcaption)"}
include_graphics("Figures/SrchExtdERPs.tiff", auto_pdf = FALSE)
```

For participants whose categorisation task remained unchanged across the 3 days, a 2x2x2 mixed ANOVA evaluated the effects of group (colour vs shape), electrode laterality (contralateral vs ipsilateral), and session (Day1 vs Day3) on ERP component amplitude. This analysis was carried out for the NT elicited by targets in the distractor absent trials, the NT elicited by lateralised targets int he presence of a midline distractor, and for the PD elicited by lateralised distractors in the presence of midline targets.

```{r srchExtdERPMeansd}
main.to.Day1 <- search.Extd.TO.aov$data$long %>% filter(Session=="Day1") %>% summarise(mean=mean(mV), sd = sd(mV))
main.to.Day3 <- search.Extd.TO.aov$data$long %>% filter(Session=="Day3") %>% summarise(mean=mean(mV), sd = sd(mV))

main.td.Day1 <- search.Extd.TD.aov$data$long %>% filter(Session=="Day1") %>% summarise(mean=mean(mV), sd = sd(mV))
main.td.Day3 <- search.Extd.TD.aov$data$long %>% filter(Session=="Day3") %>% summarise(mean=mean(mV), sd = sd(mV))
```

##### Target response - Distractor absent trials

The results showed a significant main effect of session where ERP amplitude on Day1 (`r mean_and_sd(main.to.Day1)`) was more negative than on Day3 (`r mean_and_sd(main.to.Day3)`, `r search.Extd.TO.results$full_result$Session`). However, session did not interact with electrode laterality (`r search.Extd.TO.results$full_result$Contra_Session`), nor group (`r search.Extd.TO.results$full_result$Group1_Session`). Extended training therefore affected the unsubtracted ERP amplitude rather than the NT component.

##### Target response - Distractor present trials

The results showed a significant main effect of session where ERP amplitude on Day1 (`r mean_and_sd(main.td.Day1)`) was more negative than on Day3 (`r mean_and_sd(main.td.Day3)`, `r search.Extd.TD.results$full_result$Session`). Session did not interact with group (`r search.Extd.TD.results$full_result$Group1_Session`), nor electrode laterality (`r search.Extd.TD.results$full_result$Contra_Session`), once again suggesting that extended training affected the unsubtracted ERP amplitude rather than the NT component.

##### Distractor response - Distractor present trials

The results showed a significant main effect of session (`r search.Extd.DTpd.results$full_result$Session`), and a significant interaction between electrode laterality and session (`r search.Extd.DTpd.results$full_result$Contra_Session`). Follow-up comparisons showed a significant PD for participants on Day1 (`r search.Extd.DTpd.fup$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_Day1`) and a reduced PD by Day3 (`r search.Extd.DTpd.fup$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_Day3`). There was no significant interaction between group and sesssion (`r search.Extd.DTpd.results$full_result$Group1_Session`).

##### Target response - Distractor absent trials

The results showed no significant main effect of training history (`r search.Retr.TO.results$full_result$GroupP`), and training history did not interact with electrode laterality (`r search.Retr.TO.results$full_result$GroupP_Contra`), nor group (`r search.Retr.TO.results$full_result$Group2_GroupP`).

##### Target response - Distractor present trials

The results showed no significant main effect of training history (`r search.Retr.TD.results$full_result$GroupP`), and training history did not interact with electrode laterality (`r search.Retr.TD.results$full_result$GroupP_Contra`), nor group (`r search.Retr.TD.results$full_result$Group2_GroupP`).

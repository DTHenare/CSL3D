### Categorisation trials

A 2x4 ANOVA was carried out in order to evaluate whether there were effects of session (initial vs extended training) and group (shape-shape, shape-colour, colour-colour, colour-shape) on participant response times. The results showed 

(ref:behavDistInt) Response time cost (response time in distractor present trials minus RT in distractor absent trials) caused by the presence of a coloured distractor in the search task. Participants assigned to respond to colour in the categorisation task (shown in green) had significantly higher costs during the search task than participants assigned to repsond to shape in the categorisation task (shown in grey). Individual response time costs are depicted as dots alongside a boxplot and violin plot to visualise the range and distribution of costs for each group.

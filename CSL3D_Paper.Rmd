# Introduction

When the human visual system is confronted by complex, cluttered visual displays, selective attention is the process which allows us to focus our limited processing capacity on relevant objects and suppress irrelevant objects. Visual selective attention relies on a set of intereacting sub-systems which operate in concert to determine the current focus of attention. Bottom-up processing is one such system which attempts to focus attention on salient stimuli like bright lights, or pop-out features like a red berry on a green background. Conversely, top-down attention is a system which prioritises stimuli that match the current goals of an individual, for example when searching for your specific car in a busy carpark. Research has recently identified a third factor which influences the current focus of attention, referred to as selection history. As the name suggests, selection history refers to processes which direct attention toward stimuli because of an individual's previous experiences or associations with those particular stimuli. This is distinct from bottom-up and top-down processes in that these stimuli may not be particularly salient in an objective sense, nor relevant to the current goals of the individual.

Experimental evidence for the central role that selection history plays in attentional orienting has started to accumulate in the attention literature. Associating on object with reward, for example, has been shown to result in attention being oriented to that object even when it is not physically salient, and in novel tasks where the target has changed and rewards are no longer being given. Eveidence for the effect of selection history also comes from intertrial priming, an effect observed in visual search tasks where target features change from trial to trial. Intertrial priming is the observation that when the target features repeat on two trials, participants respond significantly faster to the repetition than to other trials. Similarly, subtle statistical regularities in object location and display configuration have been shown to speed participant responses in a way which suggests that historic associations are incorporated in visual search and help to determine the locus of attention. Reward association, priming, and statistical regularity are three prominent lines of research demonstrating the role that selection history palys in attentional orienting, research has continued to build on these effects in order to understand the dynamics of selection history within the broader attention system.



## CSLChoice

Everyday visual scenes contain far more information than the human visual system can process at a given point in time. Effective functioning in spite of this limitation requires a system which can flexibly focus its processing on the most relevant parts of a scene. Historically, models of this process have posited that selection is driven by the interaction between bottom-up and top-down influences. Bottom-up processes are based on the physical properties of a stimulus, biasing selection toward things like bright, flashing lights and loud, sudden noises. Top-down processes on the other hand are based on the internal goals of the individual, biasing selection toward, for example, the red and white hat worn by a friend that you’ve lost in a crowd. More recently, @awh2012top suggested that a third factor, selection history, is integrated with both top-down and bottom-up information in order to guide attention in a visual scene.

Selection history refers to an individual’s previous experience of encountering and responding to a stimulus in a given context [@awh2012top], and a range of experiments have provided evidence of its impact on attention. One such example of how selection history impacts on the deployment of attention is demonstrated by intertrial priming. In visual search tasks where target features vary from trial to trial, intertrial priming refers to the observation that participants respond significantly faster to the current target when it matches the features of the target from the preceding trial [@fecteau2007priming;@nakayama2004short;@maljkovic1994priming;@wolfe2003changing]. Notably, features associated with a previous trial’s target are primed even in cases where they contradict the current top-down goals of the participant [@maljkovic1994priming]. It has also been shown that associating a stimulus with reward can produce increased attentional capture by that stimulus long after the reward has stopped [@laurent2015valuable;@wang2018stimuli;@hickey2013reward;@donohue2016rapid]. Similarly, subtle statistical regularities in target and distractor location across a task have been demonstrated to produce implicit changes in the efficiency of both target selection and distractor suppression processes [@ferrante2018altering;@wang2018statistical;@failing2019spatial]. Intertrial priming, reward association, and statistical learning all demonstrate the critical role that selection history plays alongside bottom-up and top-down influences on attentional control.

The impact that selection history has on the allocation of attention has also been shown to persist even when participants are performing a different task. @feldmann2015you demonstrated this using a dual task paradigm in which participants performed either a categorisation task or a search task on each trial. During the categorisation task, participants learned to categorise stimuli based on either colour or shape, while in the search task they searched for a shape singleton and responded to the rotated line that it contained. Their results showed that when colour distractors were present in the search displays, they caused greater interference for participants who had performed colour categorisation in the categorisation task. This implies that colour became more salient as a result of selection history, and follow-up experiments showed that these effects persist when the tasks are performed in separate blocks, and on separate days [@kadel2017selection].

Additional insight into the effect of selection history on attention has been provided through the measurement of neural indices of attention processing recorded by EEG. One of the predominant components used to study attention is an enhanced negativity recorded at posterior electrode sites contralateral to an attended stimulus, occurring approximately 200ms after stimulus onset. Referred to as N2pc, this component is generally considered to reflect the deployment of spatially selective attention to the stimulus location [@grubert2016all;@luck1994spatial;@luck1994electrophysiological;@li2018further;@tan2015understanding], and has been used as an index of attentional capture by relevant stimuli [@kiss2008n2pc;@berggren2018object;@mccants2018guidance] and pop-out objects [@eimer2007attentional;@holguin2009n2pc]. In their dual task investigation into the effects of selection history on attention, @feldmann2015you showed that during search trials, participants who had performed colour categorisation in the categorisation task produced an N2pc to the colour distractor whereas participants who performed shape categorisation did not. These data support the suggestion that selection history results in the automatic allocation of attention to stimuli even when they are currently task irrelevant.

Recently, methodological developments have allowed for even more specific measures of attention processing using EEG. Efficient attentional orienting depends not only on efficient mechanisms for identifying and orienting to targets, but also the identification and suppression of possible distractors. Distinguishing between these processes using only behavioural measures can be difficult, however, recent research has identified a set of lateralised event-related potentials that can provide dissociable measures of object selection and suppression. Central to the calculation of the N2pc is the subtraction of any neural activity that is represented equally in both hemispheres. @hickey2009electrophysiological took advantage of this fact in order to dissociate target and distractor processing. Participants in their task performed a visual search task in which both a target and distractor were present, but only one of these objects was lateralised on a given trial. When a target is lateralised and the distractor is on the midline, calculation of lateralised ERPs results in subtraction of all distractor activity and isolation of lateralised target processing. Similarly, when the distractor is lateralised, activity related to distractor processing can be isolated. Results using this approach have identified a lateralised positivity reflecting attentional disengagement from a stimulus in addition to the lateralised negativity indexing the attentional selection of a stimulus [@gaspelin2018combined;@gaspar2014suppression;@hickey2009electrophysiological].

Specific measures of attentional selection and suppression have provided increased specificity of the role that selection history plays in the orienting of attention. In a follow-up experiment @feldmann2015you adapted their task in order to allow for the dissociation of target and distractor processing. Their results showed that for participants who categorised based on colour in the categorisation task, the presentation of a coloured distractor in the search task elicited an N$_{\text{D}}$ (a lateralised negativity to distractors) followed by a relatively large P$_{\text{D}}$ (a lateralised positivity to distractors). This implies that for these participants, the colour distractor captured attention in the search task (reflected by N$_{\text{D}}$) and therefore required increased subsequent suppression (reflected by increased P$_{\text{D}}$). Participants who had learned to categorise based on shape however did not show this effect. The colour distractor in their case elicited no ND during search trials and a small P$_{\text{D}}$, indexing a lack of attentional capture and decreased distractor suppression respectively.

# Methods

## Participants

27 participants with normal or corrected-to-normal vision (tested using an Oculus Binoptometer 3) participated in the task for either payment or course credit. All participants gave written and informed consent prior to the start of the experiment. Participants were randomly assigned to either the shape group (ages ranging from 21 to 31, mean = 24.5, SD = 2.8) or the colour group (ages ranging from 19 to 25, mean = 22.5, SD = 1.7). Each group had one left handed participant and all other participants were right handed. One participant did not reach suitable performance during the practice session and was therefore excluded from the experiment.

## Experimental procedure

Participants came in for two separate sessions and performed two different tasks within each session, a categorisation task and a search task (described in detail below). In session one, participants were familiarised with the two tasks by performing them in separate blocks. In session two, the full task began where participants chose at the start of each trial whether they would perform a categorisation or search trial. Participants were seated in a comfortable chair in a dimly lit room with their eyes 100cm away from the screen (LCD-TN Samsung Syncmaster 2233). An Erogodex DX1 response pad was placed on their lap with 6 keys arranged so that participants could use the index and middle finger of each hand to respond to the task, while the thumb on each hand could be used to perform task selection between trials. Stimulus presentation and response collection was controlled by E-Prime 2.0 and audio feedback was presented by two stereo speakers (Logitech Z120 2.0) placed behind the screen.

### Stimuli

Each stimulus presented during the categorisation and search trials was presented on a dark grey background (RGB: 60,60,60) and subtended 2.3$^\circ$ of visual angle. A fixation cross (0.6$^\circ$) was located in the centre of the screen throughout the experiment in order to help participants maintain central fixation. The physical luminance of the grey (RGB: 110,110,110), green (RGB: 48,171,48), blue (RGB: 48,48,171), and red (RGB: 171,48,48) stimulus colours was balanced using a luminance meter (Konica Minolta LS-100).

(ref:stimDispFig) Example stimulus displays for the categorisation (A) and search tasks (B). In each display, one singleton is lateralised and the other is on the midline in order to allow for the calculation of EEG activity elicited by the lateral stimulus. Participants performed 1152 trials in total, 50% of these were required to be categorisation trials (half of each display type) and 50% were required to be search trials (one third of each display type).

include_graphics("Figures/CSL3D trial displays.jpg", auto_pdf = FALSE)
```


### Categorisation trials

Categorisation trials began with a 500 ms fixation cross in the center of the screen. Eight stimuli were then presented simultaneously in a circular arrangement with a radius of 6.3$^\circ$ of visual angle for 200 ms (see Figure\ \@ref(fig:stimDisplays)A). Six of these objects were unfilled grey circles, one was an unfilled coloured circle (either blue or green randomly selected on each trial), and one was an unfilled grey shape singleton (either pentagon or triangle selected randomly on each trial). The colour singleton and the shape singleton were constrained to appear in only four of the eight possible locations along either the vertical or horizontal midline. In half of the categorisation trials (288 trials), the shape singleton was presented on one of the vertical midline positions while the colour singleton was presented on one of the lateral positions on the horizontal midline. In the other half of categorisation trials the colour singleton was on the vertical midline while the shape singleton was lateralised (see Figure\ \@ref(fig:stimDisplays)A). Participants had two response keys for the categorisation task and after selecting one of these keys, they were given feedback informing them whether they had selected the correct response. At the beginning of the task, participants were not told the correct stimulus response pairing and instead had to learn which key was correct for a given display. For half of the participants (the colour group) the correct response was based on the colour singleton (eg. key 1 when blue was shown, key 2 when green was shown). For the other half (the shape group), the correct response was based on the shape singleton (eg. key 1 when a pentagon was shown, key 2 when a triangle was shown).The trial would end when participants made their response, up to a maximum of 2000 ms.

### Search trials

Search trials began with a 500 ms fixation cross in the center of the screen. Next, eight stimuli were presented in a circular arrangement with a radius of 6.3$^\circ$ of visual angle for an interval of 200 ms (see Figure\ \@ref(fig:stimDisplays)B). Six of these were always unfilled grey circles, one was the target - an unfilled grey diamond, and one was either another unfilled grey circle (in the target only condition) or an unfilled red circle (in the distractor present condition). Each of these stimuli contained a line of varying orientations and participants were required to indicate whether the line contained by the target diamond was oriented horizontally or vertically. The trial would end when particpants made their response, up to a maximum of 2000 ms. One third of the search trials (192 trials) were target only trials with 7 grey circles and one grey diamond target. The other two thirds of the search trials were distractor present trials in which one of the circles was coloured red. In half of these distractor present search trials (192 trials), the target diamond was placed on the vertical midline and the coloured distractor was lateralised to either the left or right (chosen randomly on each trial) along the horizontal midline. In the remaining trials (192 trials) the coloured distractor was placed on the vertical midline and the target diamond was lateralised to either the left or right (chosen randomly on each trial) on the horizontal midline (see Figure\ \@ref(fig:stimDisplays)B).

### Task selection

In session two, every trial began with a task selection screen where participants had to indicate using either their left or right thumb, whether they would like to perform a categorisation or search trial. This screen stayed on until the participant's response. Participants were asked to try to ensure that they distributed their choices evenly between the two options, and to try and make their choice random and unpredictable. Participants were required to perform 576 of each trial type and after every block of 32 trials, tey were shown a pictoral display indicating how many of each trial type was left for them to perform as well as some feedback about response times and accuracy. Examples of the full trial procedure and a between block feedback display are shown in figure\ \@ref(fig:trialProc).

(ref:trialProcFig) Trial procedure (A). Participants started each trial by selecting which of two tasks they would perform next. After a 500ms delay, their chosen task display was presented. In the case of a categorisation display, they would categorise either the shape or colour singleton (depending on group assignment) whereas in the search task all participants would respond to the orientation of the line within the shape singleton. An example of the feedback display (B) shown to participants between blocks which provides information about the percentage of trials left for each task, as well as the number of blocks completed, average accuracy for each task, and average response time for each task.

## EEG recording

EEG activity was recorded continuously at 1000Hz using Brain Products 64 channel actiCAP Ag/AgCl electodes.The electrodes were arranged according to the modified combinatorial nomenclature (MCN) for the 10-10 system. The online reference was FCz and the COM sensor was located on the z axis between FCz and Cz. EEG activity was preamplified by the active electrodes and then passed to a brain products brainamp amplifier with 16 bit A/D conversion, an input impedance of 10MOhms, and an antialiasing filter with a 1000Hz low pass cut off. Impedances were kept below 5kOHms and active shielding was used throughout for attenuating common mode noise.

## EEG processing

EEG data were processed using the EEGLAB toolbox in MATLAB. First, data were segmented into 700ms epochs (-200 to 500ms around each search or categorisation display) and baselined so that the average of the pre-stimulus period was set to zero for each event. For artifact rejection a HEOG channel was created by taking the voltage difference between the electrodes on the outer canthi of each eye, and a VEOG was created by taking the voltage difference between the electrodes above and below the left eye. These channels were filtered using a lowpass value of 35Hz in order to reduce false positives, and then trials containing either +/- 35mV in the HEOG channel (within 300ms post stimulus presentation) or +/- 80mV in the VEOG channel were removed. Trials containing +/- 80mv in the channels of interest (PO3, PO7, PO4, and PO8) were also removed and the data were referenced to the average of all channels. Left hemisphere channels (PO3, PO7) were averaged together, and right hemisphere channels (PO4, PO8) were averaged together so that contralateral and ipsilateral ERPs could be calculated for each condition.

## Statistical analysis

Throughout the results section data are analysed to focus on three effects, the initial training effect, extended training effect, and the retraining effect. For the initial training effect we focus on data from the first session and make comparisons between participants who are performing colour categorisation to participants performing shape categorisation. This represents a replication of previous studies showing that participants who categorise colour in the categorisation task (when compared to shape categorisation) are more distracted by colour singletons in the search task. For the extended training effect we aim to evaluate how this initial training effect is modulated by an extended period of training across 3 days. Therefore, we focus on participants who continue to categorise the same feature across all 3 days of the experiment, and compare their response in the first session to the responses in the final session. This allows us to understand whether extended performance of these tasks results in strengthened selection history effects and therefore an even greater difference between shape and colour categorisers, whether this effect is diminished by repeated practice for both groups, or whether the selection history effect reaches its peak in the first session and is unaffected by repeated training. For the retraining effect we aim to understand how changing the group assignment on day two impacts on selection history effects by day three. To this end, we focus on performance from day three, and split participant groups not only by the feature dimension that they are currently categorising, but by whether or not the relevant dimension has changed since day one (e.g. from shape categorisation to colour categorisaiton and vice versa). In this way we aim to understand, for example for participants currently performing colour categorisation, whether their performance is different if they have a previous history of shape categorisation as compared to unchanged history of colour categorisation across all 3 days.

### Behavioural analyses

For behavioural analyses we removed trials with abnormally long reaction times (greater than 2.5 standard deviations above the mean, calculated separately for each participant and each task) resulting in the removal of an average of 2.86% of trials in the categorisation task, and 2.66% of trials in the search task. For analyses with response time as the dependent variable, we again removed trials with abnormally long reaction times (as above) but additionally we removed trials with incorrect responses resulting in the removal of an average of 4.28% of the categorisation trials and 3.77% of search trials in total.

### ERP analyses


In the categorisation task, participants had to be excluded because less than 70% of the trials were left in the categorisation task (equivalent to an average of 202 trials remaining in each condition), or because their switch rate between the tasks was less than 0.2. Our analyses focused on two components of interest, the N$_{\text{T}}$ and P$_{\text{D}}$. In order to determine the time range for the N$_{\text{T}}$, a grand average ERP of all participants was created for lateralised predictor trials (colour singleton for colour group participants and shape singleton for shape participants). The peak negativity that occurred later than 200ms post-stimulus was defined as the Nt, and a 50ms time window was centred on this timepoint producing a window from 206 to 256ms. For the P$_{\text{D}}$ component, we created a grand average ERP for lateralised non-predictor trials (the shape singleton for the colour group and the colour singleton for the shane group), identified the peak positivity that occurred later than 200ms poststimulus and centred a 50ms window on this timepoint which produced a window from 237 to 287ms.

Five participants were excluded because less than 85% of trials remained in the search task after artifact rejection (equivalent to an average of 163 trials remaining in each condition), or their switch rate between the tasks was less than 0.2. We again focused analyses on the N$_{\text{T}}$ and P$_{\text{D}}$ components. To select the N$_{\text{T}}$ time window we created a grand average of all participants for trials with a lateralised target, identified the peak negativity that occurred later than 200ms poststimulus and centred a 50ms window on this time point. This produced a time range of 227 to 277ms post-stimulus onset. For the P$_{\text{D}}$ component, we created a grand average ERP for trials with a lateralised distractor, identified the peak positivity that occurred later than 200ms poststimulus and centred a 50ms window on this timepoint which produced a window from 264 to 314ms.

```

### Categorisation trials

#### Initial training.

When focussing on performance from Day1, independent samples t-tests showed no significant difference between the shape group and the colour group in terms of response times (`r apa_print(cat.rt.init.aov)$full_result$InitSess`) and accuracy (`r apa_print(cat.acc.init.aov)$full_result$InitSess`).

#### Extended training.

For participants whose categorisation task remained unchanged across the 3 days, a 2x2 mixed ANOVA evaluating the effects of group (colour vs shape) and session (Day1 vs Day3) on response times revealed no significant main effect of group across the task (`r apa_print(cat.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess`), however a significant main effect of session showed that repsonse times were slower on Day3 (`r apa_print(cat.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$Session`). There was no significant interaction between group and session (`r apa_print(cat.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess_Session`). 
When this analysis was repeated for accuracy, we again saw no significant main effect of group (`r apa_print(cat.acc.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess`), however a significant main effect of session revealed that participants became significantly less accurate by Day3 (`r apa_print(cat.acc.extd.aov)$full_result$Session`). There was no significant interaction between group and session (`r apa_print(cat.acc.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess_Session`).

#### Retraining.

To evaluate the effects of retraining we focussed on data from Day3 and used a 2x2 mixed ANOVA to evaluate the effect of categorisation group (colour vs shape), and training history (changed vs unchanged) on response times. The results showed no significant main effect of group (`r apa_print(cat.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$FinSess`), no significant main effect of training history (`r apa_print(cat.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$retrain`), and no interaction between group and training history (`r apa_print(cat.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$retrain_FinSess`). When this analysis was repeated with accuracy as the dependent variable, we again saw no significant main effect of group (`r apa_print(cat.acc.retr.aov)$full_result$FinSess`), no significant main effect of training history (`r apa_print(cat.acc.retr.aov)$full_result$retrain`), and no interaction between group and training history (`r apa_print(cat.acc.retr.aov)$full_result$retrain_FinSess`).

### Search trials

#### Initial training.

When focussing on performance from Day1, a 2x2 mixed ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of group (colour vs shape) and dsitractor presence (present vs absent) on response times in the search task. The results showed no significiant main effect of group (`r apa_print(srch.rt.init.aov)$full_result$InitSess`), however there was a significant main effect of distractor presence (`r apa_print(srch.rt.init.aov)$full_result$CompCond`) with participants performing slower in the presence of a coloured distractor, and a significant interaction between gorup and distractor presence (`r apa_print(srch.rt.init.aov)$full_result$InitSess_CompCond`). Follow-up tests on this analysis revealed that the distractor interference effect was larger for participants in the colour group.

#### Extended training.

For participants whose categorisation task remained unchanged across the 3 days, a 2x2x2 mixed ANOVA evaluated the effects of group (colour vs shape), session (Day1 vs Day3), and distractor presence (present vs absent) on response times. The results showed no significant main effect of group (`r apa_print(srch.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess`), however there were significant main effeccts of both session (`r apa_print(srch.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$Session`) and distractor presence (`r apa_print(srch.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$CompCond`). Distractor presence also showed significant interactions with group (`r apa_print(srch.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess_CompCond`) where we see significantly larger distractor interference for participants in the colour group as compared to the shape group. Distractor presence also interacted with session (`r apa_print(srch.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$Session_CompCond`), where distractor intereference decreased by the final session. There was no significant interaction between group and session (`r apa_print(srch.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess_Session`), and the three-way interaction between group, session, and distractor presence only approached significance (`r apa_print(srch.rt.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess_Session_CompCond`). 

This analysis was repeated using search task accuracy as the dependent variable. Results showed a significant main effect of session (`r apa_print(srch.acc.extd.aov)$full_result$Session`), where participants were more accurate in the final session, but no main effect of neither group (`r apa_print(srch.acc.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess`), nor distractor presence (`r apa_print(srch.acc.extd.aov)$full_result$CompCond`). We also see no interactions between group and session (`r apa_print(srch.acc.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess_Session`), group and distractor presence (`r apa_print(srch.acc.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess_CompCond`), and session and distractor presence (`r apa_print(srch.acc.extd.aov)$full_result$Session_CompCond`). Finally, the three-way interaction between group, session, and distractor presence was also not significant (`r apa_print(srch.acc.extd.aov)$full_result$InitSess_Session_CompCond`).

#### Retraining.

To evaluate the effects of retraining we focussed on data from Day3 and used a 2x2x2 mixed ANOVA to evaluate the effect of Day3 categorisation group (colour vs shape), training history (changed vs unchanged), and distractor presence (present vs absent) on response times. The results showed no significant effect of training history (`r apa_print(srch.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$retrain`), however we did see a significant main effect of distractor presence (`r apa_print(srch.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$CompCond`) where participants were slower in the presence of a salient distractor, and the main effect of group was approaching significance (`r apa_print(srch.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$FinSess`). We saw no significant interactions between group and training history (`r apa_print(srch.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$retrain_FinSess`), nor training history and distractor presence (`r apa_print(srch.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$retrain_CompCond`), however we did see a significant interaction between group and distractor presence (`r apa_print(srch.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$FinsSess_CompCond`). As before, this was a consequence of larger distractor costs for participants in the colour group. The significant three-way interaction between group, training history, and distractor presence was not significant (`r apa_print(srch.rt.retr.aov)$full_result$retrain_FinSess_CompCond`).

(ref:behavDistInt) Response time cost (response time in distractor present trials minus RT in distractor absent trials) caused by the presence of a coloured distractor in the search task. Participants assigned to respond to colour in the categorisation task (shown in green) had significantly higher costs during the search task than participants assigned to repsond to shape in the categorisation task (shown in grey). Individual response time costs are depicted as dots alongside a boxplot and violin plot to visualise the range and distribution of costs for each group.

## ERP results

### Search

#### Initial training

```{r loadInitERPResults}
load('DataOutput/SrchInitERPANOVAs.RData')
```

When focussing on performance from Day1, a 2x2 mixed ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of group (colour vs shape) and electrode lateralirty (contralateral vs ipsilateral) on ERP component amplitude in the search task. This analysis was carried out for the NT elicited by targets in the distractor absent trials, the NT elicited by lateralised targets int he presence of a midline distractor, and for the PD elicited by lateralised distractors in the presence of midline targets.

##### Target response - Distractor absent trials

```{r loadSrchInitPlot}
include_graphics("Figures/SrchInitERPs.tiff", auto_pdf = FALSE)
```

The results showed no significant main effect of group on NT amplitude (`r search.Init.TO.results$full_result$Group1`), however there was a main effect of electrode laterality (`r search.Init.TO.results$full_result$Contra`), and an interaction between group and laterality (`r search.Init.TO.results$full_result$Group1_Contra`). Follow-up comparisons of this interaction showed a significant NT was elicited by targets for participants in the shape group (`r search.Init.TO.results$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_S`) but not the colour group (`r search.Init.TO.results$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_C`).

##### Target response - Distractor present trials

The results showed no significant main effect of group on NT amplitude (`r search.Init.TD.results$full_result$Group1`), however there was a main effect of electrode laterality (`r search.Init.TD.results$full_result$Contra`), and an interaction between group and laterality (`r search.Init.TD.results$full_result$Group1_Contra`). Follow-up comparisons of this interaction showed a significant NT was elicited by targets for participants in the shape group (`r search.Init.TD.results$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_S`) and that the NT was present but reduced for the colour group (`r search.Init.TD.results$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_C`).

##### Distractor response - Distractor present trials

The results showed no significant main effect of group on PD amplitude (`r search.Init.DTpd.results$full_result$Group1`), however there was a main effect of electrode laterality (`r search.Init.DTpd.results$full_result$Contra`), and an interaction between group and laterality (`r search.Init.DTpd.results$full_result$Group1_Contra`). Follow-up comparisons of this interaction showed a significant PD was elicited by targets for participants in the shape group (`r search.Init.DTpd.results$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_S`) and that the PD was enhanced for the colour group (`r search.Init.DTpd.results$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_C`).

For participants whose categorisation task remained unchanged across the 3 days, a 2x2x2 mixed ANOVA evaluated the effects of group (colour vs shape), electrode laterality (contralateral vs ipsilateral), and session (Day1 vs Day3) on ERP component amplitude. This analysis was carried out for the NT elicited by targets in the distractor absent trials, the NT elicited by lateralised targets int he presence of a midline distractor, and for the PD elicited by lateralised distractors in the presence of midline targets.

The results showed no significant main effect of group (`r search.Extd.TO.results$full_result$Group1`), however there were significant main effects of both electrode laterality (`r search.Extd.TO.results$full_result$Contra`) and session (`r search.Extd.TO.results$full_result$Session`). There was a significant interaction between group and electrode laterality (`r search.Extd.TO.results$full_result$Group1_Contra`) with follow-up comparisons showing a significant NT for participants in the shape group (`r search.Extd.TO.fup$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_S`) but not for participants in the colour group (`r search.Extd.TO.fup$full_result$Contralateral_Ipsilateral_C`). There was no significant interaction between group and sesssion (`r search.Extd.TO.results$full_result$Group1_Session`), laterality and session (`r search.Extd.TO.results$full_result$Contra_Session`), and no significant three-way interaction between group, laterality, and session (`r search.Extd.TO.results$full_result$Group1_Contra_Session`).

#### Retraining

```{r loadRetrERPResults}
load('DataOutput/SrchRetrERPANOVAs.RData')
```

To evaluate the effects of retraining we focussed on data from Day3 and used a 2x2x2 mixed ANOVA to evaluate the effect of Day3 categorisation group (colour vs shape), electrode laterality (contralateral vs ipsilateral), and training history (changed vs unchanged) on ERP component amplitude. This analysis was carried out for the NT elicited by targets in the distractor absent trials, the NT elicited by lateralised targets in the presence of a midline distractor, and for the PD elicited by lateralised distractors in the presence of midline targets.

##### Target response - Distractor absent trials

```{r loadSrchRetrPlot}
include_graphics("Figures/SrchRetrERPs.tiff", auto_pdf = FALSE)
```

The results showed a significant main effect of electrode laterality (`r search.Retr.TO.results$full_result$Contra`), indicating that an NT was elicited by targets. We saw no significant main effects of group (`r search.Retr.TO.results$full_result$Group2`) and training history (`r search.Retr.TO.results$full_result$GroupP`). We also saw no significant interactions between group and laterality (`r search.Retr.TO.results$full_result$Group2_Contra`), group and training history (`r search.Retr.TO.results$full_result$Group2_GroupP`), and laterality and training history (`r search.Retr.TO.results$full_result$GroupP_Contra`).

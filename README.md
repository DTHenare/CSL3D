# CSL3D

CSL_Choice_Paper.Rmd is an R markdown document that, when knitted, processes the EEG and behavioural data from an attention task, creates plots, runs statistical tests, and outputs everything as a word document written in the form of a scientific paper.
CSL_Producedata.Rmd takes the raw participant data and processes it to produce the statistics and figures that are used in CSL_Choice_Papaer.Rmd

In this experiment, participants were given two tasks to perform. One was a simple categorisation task that was designed to develop an implicit attentional bias toward a type of visual feature. In the second task, participants performed an unrelated visual search task and we used behavioural and EEG measures to observe how the biases that they developed during the categorisation task, continued to bias their attention in the unrelated search task. We extended this across multiple days of learning and searching in order to see how the effects of their categorisation history impact on search over longer periods of time. We also included participants whose categorisation learning was modified halfway through in order to counteract their previous learning. We used behavioural and EEG measures to show how extended categorisation of a visual feature over time leads to an automatic attentional bias toward that feature, and how these effects persist even when challenged by new learning regimes.
